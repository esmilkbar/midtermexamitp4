              The Ati-Atihan Festival in Kalibo, held annually each January,
              encapsulates Filipino culture and spirituality. Originating as
              homage to the Santo Niño, it attracts pilgrims and tourists.
              Participants don elaborate costumes and paint their bodies to
              resemble the indigenous Aeta or Ati people, enhancing the
              festival's visual allure. Devotees seek blessings and offer
              prayers, and cultural exchange is fostered through parades and
              performances, embodying resilience and tradition in Filipino
              heritage.

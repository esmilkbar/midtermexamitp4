            It is dedicated to the 19 martyrs of Aklan who initiated the revolt
            against Spain. Hence, the street where the shrine stands is named

            Considered as the highest geographical location in the municipality,
            Tigayon hill is the former secret sanctuary of the province's
            freedom fighters which anyone can hike or trek at present. It has
            been developed to provide visitors a more convenient tread and see
            through its lush flora towards the top.

          <p class="card__description">
            Originally built in 1581, to this day it stands as the oldest
            edifice of worship in the province. It was renovated in 1993 with
            the spiritual and financial support of the Aklanons themselves. The
            church's edifice was subsequently renovated immediately after it was
            slightly wrecked by the 1990 earthquake. Its architectural design
            was beautifully crafted by the renowned national artist Leandro V.
            Locsin.
